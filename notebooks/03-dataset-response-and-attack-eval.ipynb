I looked that up from the [Gemma Technical Report](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/gemma-report.pdf) for the chat / instruction tuned model, but there has been some [chat about it](https://unsloth.ai/blog/gemma-bugs) that it is not correct.

Consequently if a model is following the instruction, than any prompt injection should not be possible. Puting it differently: the Null Hypothesis is that a perfectly working prompt injection mitigation, which generalizes to all unseen poison types, is actually a model that is perfectly following the instructions as intended. This Null Hypothesis is not true, but it is a very strong assumption that can be used to reason about the model's behavior."

I was initially hoping to find a good task that the model completes well close to a 100% of the time, then find attacks that can fool the model into another task close to 100% of the time. Then I could rely on the 'has_prompt_injection' column to determine if the model was successful or not. Instead I either improve the dataset or the attacks, or rely on the labels from the automated evaluation... I will probably do all three."
