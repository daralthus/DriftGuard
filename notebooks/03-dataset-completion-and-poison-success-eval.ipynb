    "- There is no clear distinction between the instruction and the email data and some emails are continued with halucinated text before the response. This is probably already a hard task for a small model like this, but it also could be the lack of prompt engineering so far.\n",
    "- Sometimes completions start with <end_of_turn> or it's repeated several times in the text. This might be an issue in my tokenization code or the offical prompt template might be incorrect. I use the prompt formatting as described in the [Gemma Technical Report](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/gemma-report.pdf), but there has been some [chat about it](https://unsloth.ai/blog/gemma-bugs) that it is not correct there. I will test this and update the prompts accordingly for the next iteration."

    "A critical step was to figure out: How can I measure my classifer's ability to correctly classify prompt injections in order to mitigate them?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic thing would be to measure the existence of the poison task in the prompt. (`poison_type != None`) \n",
    "\n",
    "But clearly, if the model doesn't follow the poison task that's not a prompt injection. It's just data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another simple thing to do would be to measure, if the secondary task of the prompt injection was successful or not. (`injection_success_automated == True`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately it is not so easy: Sometimes the model follows the primary instruction, fails on the secondary instruction, but the execution of the primary task is still influenced by the secondary instruction in some unexpected way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should I count partial execution of prompt injection successful as well?\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to think about instruction tuning first: Instruction following is imitation. Somewhat underspecified. Weak supervision to condition the generation of outputs.\n",
    "The issue is that existing instruction tuning datasets do not differentiate between instructions, so a model tries to follow all of them, whenever it can.\n",
    "And whenever if can't it goes out of the training distribution, into undefined territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial execution of the secondary task leads to out of domain generations. To mitigate we would need to catch:\n",
    "- Executing a secondary task\n",
    "- Failing to properly follow the primary task that we were able to do before\n",
    "\n",
    "Any defense against prompt injections is impossible, if there is no proper adherence to the instructions in the first place.\n",
    "- On the one end: if the model is too dumb to follow any instruction, it won't follow secondary instructions either. \n",
    "- On the other end, if the model is following the primary instruction perfectly (no undefined behaviour), than any prompt injection should not be possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "Puting it differently: the Null Hypothesis would be that a perfectly working prompt injection mitigation, which generalizes to all unseen poison types, is actually a model that is perfectly following the instruction as intended.\n",
    "This Null Hypothesis is of course not true: we cannot attribute all out of domain (ood) generations to the poison tasks, as the primary instruction is underspecified too. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we could use a weak form: Any halucination, ood behaviour or other degradation could be attributed to prompt injections, but only up to the rate of the model's original performance on any instruction following task. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you think this is complicated, the good news is: we only have a single primary task at a time. Since we train a new classifier for each primary task we can ignore the 'any' and directly measure the primary task completion. \n",
    "What happend here is that instead of measuring task completion of possibly previously unseen poison tasks, (and always being one step behind of intruders), we shifted the problem to measuring the model's ability to follow the primary instruction! That is still somewhat challenging, if we want some generality to unseen user data, but we would need to do it anyway and much less so than re-training with new poison types all the time!\n",
    "\n",
    "The limitation is that our mitigation will be only as good as the primary instruction following is on all possible inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion: the baseline for prompt injection mitigation will be the model's ability to follow the primary instruction without any injected poison task. (`completion_success == True` & `poison_type == None`)\n",
    "Any degradation on top of the usual failure rate will be attributed to the prompt injections. The classifier will be measured on:\n",
    "1. how well it can predict the secondary task completion. (`injection_success == True`) together with\n",
    "2. how well it can predict the primary task completion and it's degradation. (`completion_success == True`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The mitigation's generalization performance to unseen poison types will be the weakend Null Hypothesis: the classifier's ability predicting degradations on the primary task. (`completion_success == True`)\n"
